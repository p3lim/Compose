Compose
======

After switching from a EU ISO keyboard layout to the US ANSI, I lost the ability to write some of the foreign characters used in my language, and some other symbols featured in the AltGr layer of my old layout.

So, instead of using the character map like a scrub, I made this tool.

======

It resurrects the [compose key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key) functionality of keyboards from ye olde days into something a bit more customizable like a software tool.

The usage is simple, you hit a designated hotkey that acts as the compose key, followed by a two-letter combination and voilà [1], you've got yourself some snazzy looking unicode symbols!

[1] The à "voilà" was written using this tool, by first pressing the compose key (which I've set to the right ctrl key), followed by "`" and finally a lowercase a.

A list of all combinations currently supported, including description and result, can be found here:
