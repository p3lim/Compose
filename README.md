Compose
======

Compose adds the functionality of a [compose key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key) to Windows, a feature commonly seen on Linux systems which allows the user to easily write special characters and accented letters.

Features
======

* Customizable key binding
* Tray icon notifications
* Keyboard LED notifications (optional)

Downloads
======

See [releases](https://github.com/p3lim/Compose/releases) for the latest stable version.

How to use
======

The usage is simple; you hit a designated hotkey that acts as the compose key, followed by a two-letter combination of keys.

For example, if you've bound the compose key to the Control key, you can write the character **รก** by executing the following key combination: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>'</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>.

A full list of combinations supported can be found in [Symbols.md](https://github.com/p3lim/Compose/blob/master/symbols.md).

Right-click the tray icon to access the settings, where you'll be able to bind your compose key.

Disclaimer
======

This software has only been tested on Windows 7 and later, I can not guarantee it will work on any earlier systems.

Please report [any bugs](https://github.com/p3lim/Compose/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) you might find, and feel free to suggest [a feature](https://github.com/p3lim/Compose/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).


Contributing
======

This is the first software I've ever developed on the Windows platform (and using C#), so I have no idea if the code is up to par with any convention.

Feel free to contribute by [forking](https://github.com/p3lim/Compose/fork) and sending me [pull requests](https://github.com/p3lim/Compose/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr).
